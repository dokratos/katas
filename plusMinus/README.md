Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

In JS the counters must be "let" and toFixed(n) is used to return the 6 decimal places.
In Java the counters must be of double type, because division with integers would return wrong values.
